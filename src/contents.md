# Skills

Altough my interests and focuses are on non-UI things such as build tools or business logic,
I'm mainly working on typical front-end projects: building UIs, writing CSS, etc...
The following list shows front9end related tools/apps/languages I have experiences for and can deal well.

- front-end languages: TypeScript, JavaScript
- build tools: webpack, Babel, tsc, postcss, posthtml
- UI libraries: React, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Lit Element
- utilities: Storybook, Jest
- other: Web Components

Non-front-end skills are Node.js, Express.js, Golang and Rust<sup>[0]</sup> to name a few.

<small>[0]: haven't used these a few years though.</small>

# Works

I can't list projects at my work, so here are projects I built or contributed to.

It's deprecated in favor of official Docs addon,
