# Skills

Typical front-end developer, focused to application/library building. Not good at design.

## Programming Languages and Libraries

Any language suited for the requirements.
For prototyping and hobby, I mainly use [Elm][elm-site] along with [TypeScript][typescript-site], and [Rust][rust-site] for WASM if neccessary.
For production applications at work, [React][react-site] with TypeScript or [lit](https://lit.dev/) with TypeScript is my go-to.

  <summary>Wanna see my code?</summary>

Here is a list of my public repos that include a TypeScript file.

- [pocka/TurtleUI (lit+TypeScript)](https://github.com/pocka/TurtleUI)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do you use CSS pre-processors like SASS?</summary>

No. CSS Modules and/or CSS custom properties would be enough for me, and I prefer simpler setup for maintainance reasons.

</details>

## Testing and Development Tools

The most of my development is done inside [Storybook][storybook-official] with a11y addon installed.
I often write pure components and container components so they can be easily tested extensively by visual testing tool, such as [reg-suit][reg-suit-site].

<details>
  <summary>Which CI do you use?</summary>

GitHub Actions, for most of the time.

# Works & Contributions

Here I picked up some of public works/contributions I made.

## pocka/storybook-addon-designs

A Storybook addon for embedding images, websites, and Figma files to provide better a design-development workflow.
A simple (someone might say "dumb") addon but is widely used and keeps up the latest version of Storybook.
