# About me

- Name: Shota Fuji
- Born in: 1993
- Location: Tokyo, Japan

A developer focusing on abstraction, usability and perfomance.
Good at engineering and coding, Not good at UI design and illustration.
I'm now working at [Impressive Inc.](https://impv.co.jp/)

I started programming at 16-17 y/o to build a computer game (it failed tho).
Since I'm geek, learning computer and programming is always fun.
Every new technology and tools fascinate me.
I heard many devs saying something like
"Front-end is too complex. Many tools and libraries. What I learned now might be dead in next year,"
but it's quite comfortable and exciting to me.

As you can see, I'm also typical Japanese: horrible at English.
If there is weird or rude in my texts/comments/chats, please bear with me.
It's because of my poor English skill, not an intended one.
