# Front-end development

The word "front-end developer" is so vague I think.
Someone builds graphical corporate sites, another builds functionality focused browser app and so on.

I am the "who build complex websites using UI libraries (e.g. React, Vue.js)".

In many cases, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is my choice.
For not-so-complex websites with no-deep-degree-of-programming team, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) is the one.
Sorry, Angular guys.

If I choose React.js for a project, I'll write whole code with TypeScript.
Flow? Sorry idk such a half-baked tool.
