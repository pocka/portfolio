# Back end development

I'm a front-end developer. **\*BUT\*** I write back-end software as well.

My origin of programming is game development, in other words, C/C++.
No fear or hesitate for type system or compiling (No, memory management, you're my enemy).
Also, as perfomance focused developer, speed of the program runs natively is so appealing to me.

My daily use language for back-end is Go and TypeScript (Node.js).
For building complex or performance and security first program, I prefer using Rust.
I tried Elixir but its way/style didn't match to me. Implicit import based on file structure is definitely evil!

The happy thing in recent is, knowledge of these back-end language and engineering can help me building high quality front-end: WASM (WebAssembly).
