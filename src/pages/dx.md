# DX

DX (Developer Experience) is one of my primary focus.
Especially, documentation and issue/PR management are the things I put many efforts in.

The reason: I belive great DX leads great UX and poor DX brings extremely poor UX.

I love making DX better (automation, documentaion or something else...) as well as building softwares.
If you felt uncomfortable in projects/works with me, feel free to tell me!

## Showcases

- [Automated release and build flow on pocka/storybook-addon-designs](https://github.com/pocka/storybook-addon-designs/blob/master/.github/main.workflow)
  - It's too simple though...
